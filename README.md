# UCL Treasure Hunt Mobile Quiz



### Menu Items

The top menu bar contains all the functionality of the mobile app:

* Home – refreshes the page and resets map extent.
* Location tracker – finds the users location and zooms to them. A circle shows the area in which questions can be answered.
* Question Finder – load the questions from the database to the map.
* Search for Question – If a question is within range it will show up as green and be available for selection. This will exit the user to an answer submission form which can be completed to return to the map.
* Drop-Down Menu - The drop-down menu has links to the user guide, technical guide and my personal GitHub.
